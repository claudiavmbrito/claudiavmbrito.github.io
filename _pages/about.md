I am currently a researcher at [INESC TEC](https://www.inesctec.pt/en) ([DSR HASLab](https://dsr-haslab.github.io/) group) and an Invited Assistant Professor at [University of Minho](https://www.uminho.pt/EN).

My current research focus is on privacy-preserving and distributed machine learning systems.
Nonetheless, my research interests have been shifting towards three other topics:

* Energy consumption and storage optimizations in modern and large-scale I/O infrastructures for deep learning workloads.
* Machine learning for systems optimizations.
* Storage optimizations for machine learning workloads.
* Distributed machine learning for biomedical research.
