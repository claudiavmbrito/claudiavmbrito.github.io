I am currently a PhD student and a researcher at [INESC TEC](https://www.inesctec.pt/en) ([DSR HASLab](https://dsr-haslab.github.io/) group) and an Invited Assistant Professor at [University of Minho](https://www.uminho.pt/EN).

My current focus is on privacy-preserving and distributed machine learning systems. Nonetheless, my interests have been shifting towards the energy consumption and storage requirements in modern, large-scale I/O infrastructures for deep learning workloads.
